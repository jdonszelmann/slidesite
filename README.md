# slidesite

Slidesite is a DSL to create slideshows. It's like a better version of latex beamers and not quite as limited as pandoc's markdown to beamer converter. 
It supports scripting with a mostly functional language, and values can be interpolated into slides anywhere you like.  

Slides can be generated as:
* HTML website which in the future may even become interactively scriptable through the same scripting language. This makes the slides a useful interactive learning tool
* PDF (not yet supported)
